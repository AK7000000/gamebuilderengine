   <h1>PushButton Engine Lesson #5: Using Embedded Images</h1>
   <p><center><em>"A novel is never anything but a philosophy put into images"</em> - Albert Camus</center></p>
   
   <p>The goal of this lesson is to guide the user in adding image assets to a game, and displaying them graphically on the screen.</p>
   
   <p>These lessons are structured in a series of steps -- small milestones that will provide focused short-term goals for incrementally understanding PushButton Engine.</p>
   
   <p>These lessons are targeted at someone who is new to PBEngine, but not necessarily new to programming.</p>

   <h2>Tutorial Resources:</h2>
   <p>To follow along with the tutorial, you can download the starter project and use it as your base to implement the tutorial:
      <ul>
         <li><a href="downloads/Lesson5Base.zip">Lesson5Base.zip</a> (8KB)</li>
      </ul>
   The completed lesson files are available at the end of the tutorial.
   </p>
   <p>As covered in Lesson 1, extract the example .zip into a personal project folder, and ensure that it builds in your build environment.</p>
   
   <p>The built .swf of the base starter project should display a blue circle near the bottom of the screen, controllable via the keyboard.</p>
   
   <h2>Introduction to the Tutorial</h2>
   
   <p>Up until this point, all of the lessons have limited themselves to only display simple colors and shapes.  In this lesson, we will begin learning how to embed and display images.</p>
   
   <p><em>Technical Note:</em> There are a few different ways that one can embed assets into a compiled Flash file.  Because it is the most universal (accessible from Flash CS4 or Actionscript / Flex based tools), this tutorial will focus on embedding assets using Actionscript and the [Embed] metadata tag.</p>
   
   <p><h2>Embedding the Assets</h2></p>
   <p>To help make embedding resources easier, PBE includes a ResourceBundle class.  This class interfaces with the ResourceManager to simplify the embedding process.</p>
   
   <p>The way to use the ResourceBundle is by creating and instantiating a class that inherits from it.</p>

   <p>To do this, create a new file in Lesson5Base/src/ called <em>MyResources.as</em> -- this will be our project's ResourceBundle.  Inside of the file, place the following code:</p>
   
   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/MyResources.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
package
{
   import com.pblabs.engine.resource.*;
   
   public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle
   {
   }
}
   </pre>
   
   <p>Inside of the src/ directory there are two image files -- <em>bg.jpg</em> and <em>fanship.png</em>.  To make the ResourceBundle aware of these files, you define a property of your descendant class that references the file with an [Embed] tag, like so:</p>
   
   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/MyResources.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
   public class MyResources extends ResourceBundle
   {
      [Embed(source="bg.jpg", mimeType='application/octet-stream')]
      public var resBg:Class;
      
      [Embed(source="fanship.png", mimeType='application/octet-stream')]
      public var resShip:Class;
   }
   </pre>
   
   <p>In order for our custom ResourceBundle to be used, we need to instantiate it from our main class.  Inside of the Lesson5Base constructor, just after we make our call to Global.startup(), create a new instance of MyResources.</p>
   
   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/Lesson5Base.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
      public function Lesson5Final()
      {
         // Start up PBE
         Global.startup(this);
         
         // Load up our embedded resources
         new MyResources( );
   </pre>
   
   <p>And that should do it!  That will embed those graphics and make them accessible to PBE.  Once a ResourceBundle is instantiated, it automatically looks at the resources that you embedded inside of it, and properly registers them with the PBE ResourceManager.</p>
   
   <p><h2>Showing Off</h2></p>
   <p>Now that the images are loaded into PBE, we can render them.</p>
   
   <p>Nearly all functionality in PBE is given through components, and rendering sprites is no exception.  To make our Hero display as the hovercraft, we will replace the SimpleShapeRenderComponent with a SpriteRenderComponent.</p>
   
   <p>In the method createHero(), update the code that sets up the render component to be like the following:</p>
   
   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/Lesson5Base.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
         // Create a simple render component to display our object

         // Here we've removed the reference to our simple shape renderer, and added a sprite render component.
         var render:SpriteRenderComponent = new SpriteRenderComponent();

         // Tell the Render component to use one of the images embedded by our ResourceLinker
         render.loadFromImage = "fanship.png";
         
         // Set our hero to render above the background.
         render.layerIndex = 10;
         
         // Point the render component to this entity's Spatial component for position information
         render.positionReference = new PropertyReference("@Spatial.position");
         // Point the render component to this entity's Spatial component for size information
         render.sizeReference = new PropertyReference("@Spatial.size");
        
         // Add our render component to the Hero entity with the name "Render"
         hero.addComponent( render, "Render" );
   </pre>

   <p>The SpriteRenderComponent has very similar parameters to the shape renderer -- the primary difference is that it now needs a filename (this must match the filename in one of the [Embed] tags of our ResourceBundle).  Because we also plan to add a background entity to the game next, we set the layerIndex property of the render component, to ensure that the hero is drawn on top of the background.</p>
   
   <p>At this point, you should be able to compile and run the game.  If everything was done correctly, then you should now see a small hovercraft in place of your old blue circle.</p>
   
   <p><a href="images/Lesson5_2.png"><img src="images/Lesson5_2.png" width="204" height="159" alt="Goodbye cruel circle"></a></p>
   
   <p><h2>Adding the Background</h2></p>  

   <p>Next, we will add a new entity to display the background image.  This entity won't move, but will just sit in the center of the screen, and only serve to display the large background sprite.</p>
   
   <p>Everything in this section of code should be pretty familiar, as it's essentially a stripped down version of the Hero code.</p>

   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/Lesson5Base.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
      private function createBackground():void
      {
         // Allocate an entity for our background sprite
         var bg:IEntity = allocateEntity();
         // Register the entity with PBE under the name "BG"
         bg.initialize("BG");
         
         // Add our spatial component to the background entity ...
         createSpatial( bg, 
            // with location of 0,0...
            new Point(0, 0)
         );
            
         // Create a simple render component to display our object

         // Just like the hero, this also uses a SpriteRenderComponent
         var render:SpriteRenderComponent = new SpriteRenderComponent();
         
         // Tell the Render component to use one of the images embedded by our ResourceLinker
         render.loadFromImage = "bg.jpg";
         
         // Set our background to render below the hero.
         render.layerIndex = 1;
         
         // Point the render component to this entity's Spatial component for position information
         render.positionReference = new PropertyReference("@Spatial.position");
        
         // Add our render component to the BG entity with the name "Render"
         bg.addComponent( render, "Render" );
      }
      
   </pre>
   
   <p>And then at the top of the file, don't forget to add a call to createBackground().</p>
      
   <p><strong>File: /Lesson5Base/src/Lesson5Base.as</strong></p>
   <pre class="brush: js">
         // Create an avatar entity
         createHero();
         
         // Create a simple background entity
         createBackground();
   </pre>


   <p>That should be the end of it!</p>
   
   <p><h2>Seeing Visions</h2></p>
   <p>After it's all compiled, you should have an .swf like the following (click to load):</p>
   <p><a href="downloads/Lesson5Final.swf"><img src="images/Lesson5_1.png" width="204" height="159" alt="I can see clearly now"></a></p>
      
   <p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>
   
   <p>Congratulations!  You have finished lesson #5, and loaded your first external assets into the game.</p>
