# IMPORTANT Change to your local system paths before using build.xml

# NOTE: There is a bug with the 3.4.0 SDK that ships with the Flash Builder 4 Beta.
# Basically ASDoc doesn't work in our situation. Use the release version of the SDK 
# or the 4.0 version and the build will work.

# Path to the FluintAIRTestRunner executable
# The test runner is an AIR app that you need to install. We package the installer 
# in this build directory.
# This defaults to "C:\\Program Files\\FluintAIRTestRunner\\FluintAIRTestRunner.exe"
