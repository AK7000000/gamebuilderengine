EditorData
   defaultValue="{value}"
      Default defaultValues are: Boolean=false, number,int,uint=0, String="".
      Only primitives can have default values, however, classes can have default
      values that consist of a pipe separated list of values for its children.
      This only works on simple classes, like flash.geom.Point.
   
   ignore="true/false"
      When used on a class, it tells the editor to not allow instances of this
      type to be created for instance type fields. When used on a field, it
      tells the editor to completely ignore the field. Private and protected
      members, read only properties, and interfaces are automatically ignored.
   
   editAs="fully.qualified.class"
      Tells the editor to treat the class like a different type. The class will
      have to implement ISerializable to be loaded by the game correctly.
   
   typeHint="fully.qualified.class"
      This is the same as the TypeHint metadata tag, but can be used with other
      tags. For example, if editAs="Array" is set on a Class, this can specify
      the child type to use for that array.
   
   extensions="comma,separated,list"
      Only applicable to Resource derived classes, this specifies the file
      extensions that are valid for the Resource type. If omitted, all
      extensions are considered valid.
   
   referenceType="static/reference/instance"
      This specifies how a complex class field should be treated. On a complex
      field, it applies directly to that field. On an Array or Dictionary, it
      applies to the child fields. A value of reference means the field will
      be referencing a named object somewhere else. This is the default for
      IEntity or IEntityComponent types. A value of instance means a new
      instance of either the fields type or a child type will be created. A
      value of static means the fields type will be used and cannot be changed.
      The default is instance.

TypeHint
   type="fully.qualified.class"
      This can be used on Array or Dictionary fields to specify the root type
      to use for children. By default, the type specified and any child types
      are used. The EditorData-referenceType metadata can be used in conjunction
      with this to modify that behavior. This can also be used on
      PropertyReference fields to specify the type of properties that can be
      referenced. If it is omitted, all types are considered valid.
