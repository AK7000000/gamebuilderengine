   <h1>PushButton Engine Manual - Getting Started</h1>
   
   <p>The first thing you will want to do is compile PBEngine. First, use the project manager, which will generate project files for a variety of common Flash development tools. Second, using your favorite supported Flash development tool, compile. Third, run your game (or a demo)!</p>

   <div id="pageToc"></div>

   <div id="contentArea">
   
   <h2>Getting Started Even Quicker</h2>
   
   <p>You may want to use the engine without building it yourself. This is easily done. Once you have downloaded our precompiled SWCs, you can add them to your favorite IDE's classpath and start using the engine and components.</p>
   
   <h2>Step 1 - Running the Project Manager</h2>
   
   <p>The PushButton Project Manager is an AIR application that is bundled with the SDK. It can automatically add projects to your build environment, package projects for distribution, and create build files (currently Ant build scripts and Flex Builder projects).</p>
   
   <p>To get the SDK ready for use, double click on the ProjectManager.air file included in the root of the SDK to install the Project Manager. You may need to get the Adobe AIR runtime from <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/">http://www.adobe.com/products/air/</a> first.</p>
   
   <p>The Project Manager is associated with .pbesln files. Once it has been installed, double click on PBE.pbesln in the root of the SDK. This will launch the Project Manager and let it know where you have installed the SDK.</p>
      
   <p>The first time you start the Manager it will ask for the location of the Flex SDK and the path for Eclipse/Flex Builder (if you use it). The Flex SDK path should be set to the root of the Flex SDK which has folders called ant, asdoc, bin, and several others. Provide the paths and hit save to continue.</p>
   
   <p>Now, hit the "Generate Build Files..." option in the left hand column. The Project Manager will regenerate all the build files for the SDK.</p>
   
   <p>At this point you can close the Project Manager and move on to step 2.</p>
   
   <h2>Step 2 - Compile Using...</h2>
   
   <h3>Flex Builder</h3>
   
   <p>There is a batch file in Build/FlexBuilder that will launch Flex Builder with its workspace set to the Build/FlexBuilder folder. If the batch file won't run, all you need to do is open Flex Builder, go to File -> Choose Workspace -> Other... and choose Build/FlexBuilder when it asks. Hit OK and you will get a nice new workspace with a few key settings already prep'ed for you.</p>

   <p>You may want to disable automatic builds (under Project -> Build Automatically), as they tend to slow Flex Builder down dramatically.</p> 
   
   <p>Once this is done, right click on the project explorer, choose Import..., then General -> Existing Projects Into Workspace.. and hit Next. Select Build/FlexBuilder as the root directory. You may have to click out of that text box for the list of projects below to update. Once that is done, make sure all the projects are selected and click Finish to import them.</p>
   
   <p>The workspace should refresh, and everything should start compiling automatically.</p>
   
   <p>Now you can build, browse projects, and so forth.</p>
   
   <h3>Ant and the Free Flex SDK</h3>
   
   <p>To do command line builds with the free Flex SDK and Ant, just go to the Build/FlexAnt and run the batch file contained within. You will need to have Ant installed and in your path to do this.</p>
   
   <p>To get Ant, go to <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant.apache.org</a> and get the appropriate version. You may want to use an installer like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/winant/">WinAnt</a> if you're on Windows, as Ant will need to be in your path.</p>                     
   
   <p>You can build specific projects by running Ant yourself from the Build/FlexSDK folder via the command line. Do this by typing <i>ant projectname</i>.</p>
   
   <h3>FlashDevelop and Other IDEs</h3>
   
   <p>Most other IDEs do not have support for multiple projects, so using them with the PushButton Engine SDK can be difficult, since it uses many projects to keep things modular. However, editing any individual project is easy - create the project, point the source path of your project to the Source/ folder of the project, and include the Library/ folder in your classpath.</p>
   
   <h2>SDK Layout</h2>
   
   <p>Now that you are able to build, let's talk about how files in the SDK are organized.</p>
   
   <ul>
   
   <li><b>Build/</b> - Contains project and build files for various development tools generated by the project manager. There is a subdirectory for each support development tool.
      <ul>
         <li><b>FlexBuilder/</b> - Contains FlexBuilder related build files.</li>
         
         <li><b>FlexSDK/</b> - Contains Ant build files to build using the free Flex SDK.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   <li><b>Documentation/</b> - Contains this manual, which covers the core engine released by PushButton Labs. Third-party components' documentation is in that component's project folder (see below).</li>
   
   <li><b>Libraries/</b> - Compiled SWCs from each library project are stored here. This is in the classpath for every project so they can access components.</li>
   
   <li><b>Projects/</b> - One or more projects are stored in here. The project generator scans for directories with .pbeproj files when it is generating build files. Note they can be nested as deep as you like to keep things organized, and relative location doesn't matter.
      <ul>
         <li><b>Demos/</b> - Contains projects that demonstrate component libraries.</li>
         <li><b>Engine/</b> - Contains projects that implement core engine features.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   <li><b>Templates/</b> - Stores template projects for the Project Manager's use. Templates are stored as ZIPs and their format is discussed later.</li> 
   
   </ul>
   
   <h2>Project Layout</h2>
   
   <p>Each project contained in the Projects folder has the same files structure. This lets the project manager automatically generate build files, and keeps development very modular so it's easy to share components with other developers.</p>
   
   <p>Projects cannot be nested within one another. The name of the project is the name of its folder. At its root, every project contains a .pbeproj file named after the project, for instance the PBEngine project contains PBEngine.pbeproj. The .pbeproj is a small XML file that describes the project, what it is, who made it, and what its dependencies are.</p>
   
   <p>Projects have a type, specified in their .pbeproj file. The type can be one of:</p>
   
   <ul>
   
   <li><b>Library</b> - indicating that the project produces a SWC, named after the project. So for the RenderingTwoD project, RenderingTwoD.swc.</li>
   
   <li><b>WebApplication</b> - indicating that the project should build a SWF, in that project's Output/ subdirectory. The Source/ folder should contain a .mxml file named after the application, which is what will be compiled to produce the SWF. For the PBEngineDemo, Source/PBEngineDemo.mxml is compiled to produce Output/PBEngineDemo.swf.</li>
   
   </ul>
   
   <p>The type influences the directories that are used. For a library, the structure looks like this:</p>
   
   <ul>
   
   <li><b><i>LibraryName</i>.pbeproj</b> - The project description file for this library. Note it will be named after the library.</li>
   
   <li><b>Documentation/</b> - Contains an index.html that contains or links to documentation for that library.</li>
   
   <li><b>Source/</b> - Source files for the library. Every file in this folder or any subdirectory will be included in the library.</li>
   
   </ul>
   
   <p>The results of building the library are stored as a SWC in the root Libraries folder in the SDK.</p>
   
   <p>For an application, the structure is a little more complex:</p>
   
   <ul>
   
   <li><b>Assets/</b> - The assets used by this project.
      <ul>
         <li><b>Images/</b> - Image files (jpg, png, gif, etc).
         <li><b>Levels/</b> - Level XML files.
         <li><b>Sounds/</b> - Sound files (mp3).
      </ul>
   </li>
   
   <li><b>Output/</b> - The SWF output from the project.</li>
   
   <li><b>Source/</b> - Source code for the project.
   
   </ul>
