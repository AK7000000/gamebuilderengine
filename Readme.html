   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   
   <p>Welcome to the PushButton Engine!</p>
   
   <p>PushButton Engine is a framework for Flash game development. Build your game with reusable gameplay, physics, rendering, and networking components - some written by others, and some written by you. There are lots of great libraries for game development on Flash, and PBEngine helps you use them more effectively.</p>
   
   <h2>The Manual</h2>
   
   <p>For information on getting started, compiling the engine, editing the level format, explanation of the API, licensing, and further information, please see the <a href="Documentation/index.html"><b>PushButton Engine Manual</b></a>.</p> 

   <h2>PushButton On The Web</h2>

   <p>The official PushButton Engine site is <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com"><b>PushButtonEngine.com</b></a>. You can learn more about the engine, browse the component store, and post your feedback and questions on the <a href="http://www.pushbuttonengine.com/forum/"><b>PushButton Engine Forums</b></a>. The engine developers are active and will be there to help you out.</p>

   <p>Our Google Code site is <a href="http://pushbuttonengine.googlecode.com/"><b>PushButtonEngine.GoogleCode.com</b></a>. You can get the latest version of the SDK, browse our public SVN repository, report issues, and read documentation there.</p>
   
   <h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
   
   <p>You should read the <a href="Documentation/02-GettingStarted.html">Getting Started</a> chapter of the manual. It tells you where everything is and how to build the SDK. Quick answers: code is in subdirectories of Project/, docs are in Documentation/. Build/ contains build files for use with Flex Builder and/or Ant. Libraries/ is where compiled component libraries go.</p>
